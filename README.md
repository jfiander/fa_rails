# FA Rails

A quick helper for using FontAwesome icons in Rails.

## Installation

**This gem is just the code for using FontAwesome in your Rails applications.**

You must still have your own FontAwesome Pro license, or install the
[Free](https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.2.0/fontawesome-free-5.2.0-web.zip)
package.

Copy the
[web download files](https://fontawesome.com/releases/5.2.0/web/download) to the
appropriate locations in your app:

- `js` => `app/asets/javascripts`
- `css` => `app/assets/stylesheets`
